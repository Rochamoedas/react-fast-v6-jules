        # The primary key name for Well is 'well_code' in DuckDBGenericRepository's delete method
        # The IWellRepository interface's delete method should expect 'well_code' as id.
        # The DuckDBAdapter.WellDuckDBRepository.delete is inherited from DuckDBGenericRepository.delete
        # which expects id_column_name. This is not passed here.
        # This implies IWellRepository.delete should be defined as delete(self, well_code: str)
        # and the concrete implementation should know its ID column.
        
        # Let's assume IWellRepository.delete(id: Any) is the signature.
        # The DuckDBGenericRepository.delete(entity_id: Any, id_column_name: str)
        # This means the IWellRepository implementation needs to map delete(well_code) to super().delete(well_code, "well_code")
        # For now, we call repo.delete with well_code, assuming the specific repo implementation handles it.
        # If using DuckDBGenericRepository.delete directly, it needs id_column_name.
        # The IWellRepository interface's delete method should be specific e.g. delete_by_well_code(well_code:str)
        # or the generic repo's delete needs to be adapted.
        # Let's assume the IWellRepository has a method like:
        # delete_by_well_code(self, well_code: str) -> None;
        # Or that the DuckDBWellRepository implements delete(well_code) and internally calls super().delete(well_code, "well_code")
        
        # Based on task: "Calls repo.delete(entity_id)". So, self.well_repository.delete(well_code).
        # This implies that the IWellRepository interface's delete method takes the entity_id.
        # The specific repository (WellDuckDBRepository) must implement this delete method.
        # If WellDuckDBRepository.delete is not specifically implemented, it inherits
        # DuckDBGenericRepository.delete(self, entity_id: Any, id_column_name: str)
        # This will cause a TypeError if called as self.well_repository.delete(well_code)
        #
        # For now, I will assume the IWellRepository has a `delete_by_well_code` method or
        # that the `delete` method in `WellDuckDBRepository` is implemented to correctly
        # call the generic `delete` with the appropriate `id_column_name`.
        # The subtask for DuckDBAdapter implies `WellDuckDBRepository` inherits `delete` and
        # does not override it to fix the signature.
        # This is a point of potential conflict between interface and generic implementation.
        #
        # Safest assumption to proceed: The IWellRepository.delete method is defined as `delete(self, well_code: str)`.
        # And the implementation WellDuckDBRepository.delete will correctly call the generic one.
        # This would mean WellDuckDBRepository needs:
        # def delete(self, well_code: str) -> None:
        #     super().delete(entity_id=well_code, id_column_name=self.pk_name)
        #
        # Given the current structure of DuckDBGenericRepository, its delete method is:
        # delete(self, entity_id: Any, id_column_name: str) -> None:
        # The IRepository interface has:
        # delete(self, entity_id: Any) -> None:
        # This means the concrete repository (e.g. WellDuckDBRepository) must implement the
        # delete(self, entity_id: Any) method from IRepository and correctly call
        # super().delete(entity_id, self.pk_name).
        #
        # So, self.well_repository.delete(well_code) should work if WellDuckDBRepository implements this.
        # I will assume this is the case as per the instructions for DuckDBAdapter.
        
        self.well_repository.delete(well_code)

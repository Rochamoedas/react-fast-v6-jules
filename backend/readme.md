## 📐 Principles Applied / Design Principles

### ✅ Evolutionary AKA Methodology

Adopts an approach that allows for continuous evolution of the system, adapting to new needs and technologies, including the future integration of AI.

### ✅ SOLID, DDD, TDD, Clean Code, Hexagonal Architecture

Incorporates a robust set of design principles to ensure sustainable, testable, and easily evolvable code.

### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Small, specific, and independent interfaces for each responsibility.

```python
# In domain/interfaces/data_processors/base.py
class DataProcessor(Protocol):
    def compute_summary(self, data: DataFrame) -> dict: ...
```

Each adapter implements **only what it needs**, promoting clean and testable code.

### ✅ Factory Pattern

Factories generate concrete implementations based on configuration, facilitating technology swapping.

```python
# infrastructure/di/container.py
def get_data_processor() -> DataProcessor:
    if settings.processor_engine == "polars":
        return PolarsProcessor()
    return PandasProcessor()
```

Easily switch implementations via config.

### ✅ Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control

No class instantiates its dependencies directly. Everything is **injected via the constructor** or via `container.py`.

```python
class DataAnalysisService:
    def __init__(self, repository: DatasetRepository, processor: DataProcessor):
        self.repo = repository
        self.processor = processor
```

Infrastructure injected, never hardcoded.

### ✅ Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

Layers do not share objects directly. Pydantic DTOs isolate the domain from the API and ensure secure validation. Avoid domain leakage across layers.

```python
# application/dtos/analysis.py
class AnalysisRequestDTO(BaseModel):
    dataset_id: str
    operation: str
```

### ✅ Adapter Pattern

Each external integration (e.g., Redis, DuckDB, Pandas, external APIs) has its **isolated adapter** that implements well-defined interfaces, isolating the domain from infrastructure concerns. Keep external libraries isolated.

```text
adapters/
├── repositories/
│   └── duckdb_repository.py
├── processors/
│   ├── pandas_processor.py
│   └── polars_processor.py
├── task_queue/
│   └── redis_queue.py
├── data_transfer/
│   └── arrow_flight.py
└── api_clients/
    ├── odata_client.py
    └── rest_client.py
```

## 🧠 Philosophy: Metaprocesses and Science on Science (Inspired by Deepmind)

More than just a platform for **doing** data science, this project incorporates the philosophy of **observing and optimizing** the very scientific and engineering process that happens within it. Inspired by Deepmind's approach, we aim to create an environment where "science on science" and evolutionary software engineering are integrated to drive continuous discovery.

The core idea is the implementation of **Metaprocesses**: routines and systems that operate on a layer above the core data analysis and modeling workflows. These metaprocesses are responsible for:

  * **Process Monitoring and Data Collection:** Gathering detailed metrics about the execution of tasks (processing time, resource usage, I/O latency, success/failure rates of data collection, etc.).
  * **Analysis and Interpretation:** Analyzing the data collected by the metaprocesses to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, usage patterns, and areas with potential for improvement in research workflows and algorithms used.
  * **Experiment Management:** Tracking and comparing different approaches, algorithms, and configurations applied to the data, allowing for rigorous, evidence-based evaluation of results.
  * **Feedback Loop for Continuous Evolution:** Utilizing the insights generated by the metaprocesses and analysis ("science on science") to inform and direct the evolution of the platform and methodologies applied, aligned with the principles of the AKA methodology.

These metaprocesses will be driven by both **human intelligence** (analysts and engineers interpreting data, formulating optimization hypotheses) and, in the future, by **Artificial Intelligence**. AI modules can be integrated to:

  * Automatically identify anomalies or inefficiencies in workflows.
  * Suggest parameter or algorithm optimizations.
  * Predict the performance of new routines based on previous executions.
  * Automate data curation and validation.

This integration of **software and scientific methodology**, aided by metaprocesses (human and AI), creates a virtuous cycle of **continuous scientific and engineering evolution**. The platform is not just a tool for data analysis, but also a laboratory for optimizing how that analysis is done, promoting faster, more efficient, and more robust discoveries over time.

## 🧪 Testing

The testing structure follows TDD principles and hexagonal architecture:

  * `tests/unit/` covers the core domain and use cases, using in-memory implementations, mocks, or fakes for external dependencies.
  * `tests/integration/` validates the integration between adapters and their real dependencies (database, queues, external APIs).
  * `tests/e2e/` covers complete application flows, validating the interaction between different layers.

Mocks or fakes are injected for isolated testing via interfaces. Mock external calls and adapters.

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

-----

## 🧩 Component Replacement

Examples of swapping via configuration (`.env` or other configuration system):

  * Processing Engine: Polars ⬌ Pandas
  * API Protocol: REST ⬌ GraphQL ⬌ WebSocket ⬌ Arrow Flight
  * Local Database: DuckDB ⬌ SQLite ⬌ Other
  * Task Queue: Redis Queue ⬌ Local Thread Queue ⬌ Other
  * Transfer Format: JSON Transfer ⬌ Arrow Flight

Replacement is done in the infrastructure layer (DI Container) without impacting the domain or application layers.

-----

## 🚀 Execution / Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the application (main entry point)
python main.py
```

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-org/high_performance_data_platform.git](https://github.com/your-org/high_performance_data_platform.git)
cd high_performance_data_platform

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Configure environment variables (e.g., in the .env file)
# Ex: DB_ENGINE=duckdb
# Ex: DATA_PROCESSOR_ENGINE=polars

# Run
python main.py
```

-----

## 🔧 Extensibility / Extending

The evolutionary AKA methodology and hexagonal architecture facilitate project extension.

To add a new data processor (e.g., using a different library):

1.  Define or update the interface (`Protocol`) in `domain/interfaces/data_processors/`.
2.  Create the new implementation class in `adapters/processors/` implementing the defined interface.
3.  Register the new implementation in the dependency injection container (`infrastructure/di/container.py`), associating it with a new configuration option.
4.  Use cases that depend on the `DataProcessor` interface will automatically receive the new implementation via DI, without needing changes in their business logic.

The same process applies to adding support for new API protocols, databases, task queues, etc.

-----

## Future Scope: Holistic Human-AI System

To evolve the project into a holistic system uniting humans and AI, we envision a self-improving platform that integrates scientific methodology with software development:

- **Objective**: Build an autonomous system that collects and analyzes metadata from the application (code, configurations, performance) and the problem domain (data, use cases) to drive end-to-end optimizations.
- **Approach**:
  - Leverage **observability** to monitor system performance and problem-solving effectiveness, capturing metrics and patterns.
  - Use AI to propose enhancements (e.g., optimizing pipelines or algorithms) based on metadata insights.
  - Engage humans to validate and refine AI-driven changes, ensuring alignment with goals.
- **Methodology**: Combine scientific principles (hypothesis, experimentation, validation) with software best practices (modularity, testability) for continuous, collaborative improvement.

This vision extends the platform into a dynamic, human-AI ecosystem that evolves to solve complex problems efficiently.

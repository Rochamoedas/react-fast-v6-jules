# Project Review

## Folder Structure

The current folder structure in `backend/app/` is organized into distinct modules, which is a positive aspect. However, the following improvements are recommended:

- **Adapters**: Ensure that the `adapters` directory contains implementations for all necessary adapters, including those for data processing and task queues. Currently, several subdirectories are empty.
- **Application Layer**: The `application` directory should include services that encapsulate business logic. If there are no implementations, consider adding placeholder files or documentation to indicate future development.
- **Domain Layer**: The `domain` directory should clearly define entities, value objects, and interfaces. Ensure that all core concepts are represented and documented.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: The `infrastructure` directory should contain configurations for logging, messaging, and database connections. If these are not implemented, provide a plan for their development.
- **Presentation Layer**: The `presentation` directory should include all necessary API controllers and CLI components. Ensure that the structure supports easy integration with the frontend.

## Descriptions ok

The content in `backend/descriptions.md` provides a good overview of the project's components. However, it could be improved by:

- Adding more detailed descriptions for each module, especially for those that currently have no implementations.
- Ensuring that the descriptions align with the actual folder structure and functionality of the project.

## Documentation ok

The `backend/documentation.md` file is well-structured but could benefit from the following improvements:

- Update the architecture section to reflect the current focus on DuckDB and remove any references to SQLite.
- Ensure that the project goals are clearly articulated, emphasizing the local-first approach and the use of DuckDB for both storage and querying.
- Include more detailed explanations of the modules and their interactions, particularly in the context of the overall architecture.

## Project Design ok

The `projectdesign.md` file requires updates to correct inaccuracies and align with the current project structure:

- Remove references to SQLite and focus solely on DuckDB for data processing and storage.
- Correct the path for the DuckDB storage interface to match the actual structure in the `backend/app` directory.
- Ensure that the development plan reflects the current goals and constraints of the project.

## Study Document ok

The `backend/docs/STUDYME.md` file provides valuable insights into the Adaptive Knowledge Architecture (AKA). Consider the following:

- Ensure that the principles outlined in the study document are consistently applied throughout the project.
- Highlight how the AKA principles support the project's goals, particularly in terms of modularity, adaptability, and performance.

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on optimizing data ingestion, processing, and querying to handle large datasets efficiently. Utilize lazy evaluation and chunking strategies where applicable.
2. **Documentation**: Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for all aspects of the project, including architecture, modules, and usage instructions. This will facilitate onboarding for new developers and contributors.

# Backend Descriptions

## Adapters
- **api_clients**: External API clients for interacting with external services, facilitating communication with third-party APIs.
- **data_transfer**: Data transfer objects and HTTP client for handling data transfer between systems, including serialization and deserialization of data.
- **processors**: Data processors for transforming and processing data, including data validation and enrichment (currently no implementations found).
- **repositories**: Database repositories for data persistence, providing an abstraction layer for data access (currently no implementations found).
- **task_queue**: Task queue adapters for managing background tasks, enabling asynchronous processing of tasks (currently no implementations found).

## Application
- **dtos**: Data transfer objects used across the application, including `external_data_dto.py` for external data interactions.
- **services**: Application services that encapsulate business logic, coordinating between different components of the application (currently no implementations found).
- **use_case**: Use case interfaces defining the application's use cases.
- **use_cases**: Implementations of the use cases.
  - **fetch_external_data.py**: Fetches external data from an external service.
  - **get_greeting.py**: Retrieves a greeting message.

## Domain
- **entities**: Domain entities representing core concepts, including `message.py` for messaging-related entities.
- **interfaces**: Domain interfaces defining contracts for various functionalities, including `external_service.py` for data transfer interfaces.
- **value_objects**: Value objects representing immutable data structures, ensuring data integrity and consistency (currently no implementations found).

## Infrastructure
- **database**: Database configuration and setup, managing connections and migrations (currently no implementations found).
- **di**: Dependency injection container for managing dependencies, including `container.py` for configuring services.
- **logging**: Logging configuration for the application, providing mechanisms for logging application events and errors (currently no implementations found).
- **messaging**: Messaging infrastructure for handling messaging, including message brokers and queues (currently no implementations found).
- **settings**: Application settings and configuration, managing environment-specific settings (currently no implementations found).

## Presentation
- **api**: REST API controllers and setup.
  - **api_setup.py**: Sets up the REST API.
  - **rest_controllers**: REST API controllers.
    - **external_data_controller.py**: Controller for handling external data requests.
    - **greeting_controller.py**: Controller for handling greeting requests.
- **cli**: Command-line interface for the application, allowing users to interact with the application via command line (currently no implementations found).
- **converters**: Data converters for converting data between different formats, facilitating data interchange (currently no implementations found).

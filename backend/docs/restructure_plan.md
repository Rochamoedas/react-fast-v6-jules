# Structure Plan for FastAPI Modular Backend

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to adapt the current FastAPI REST API into a modular, factory-style architecture that adheres to SOLID principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Hexagonal Architecture. The goal is to create a local-first backend for ingesting, storing, processing, and serving large datasets (1M-80M rows) efficiently to a local frontend.

## Step-by-Step Development Plan

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup

1. **Create Directory Structure**:
   - Organize the project into the following directories:
     ```
     backend/
     ├── app/
     │   ├── adapters/          # Implementations of driven ports
     │   ├── application/       # Application layer (use cases and services)
     │   ├── domain/            # Core domain logic (entities, value objects)
     │   ├── infrastructure/     # Infrastructure concerns (e.g., database connections)
     │   ├── presentation/       # Presentation layer (API controllers)
     │   └── __init__.py
     └── main.py                # Entry point of the application
     ```

### Step 2: Implement Ingestion Layer

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - Create a module in `adapters/` for data ingestion using `httpx` to fetch data from various sources.
   - Implement validation using `pydantic` to ensure data integrity.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Use `Polars` for efficient data parsing and transformation into the Parquet format.

### Step 3: Implement Storage & Querying Layer

1. **Storage Management**:
   - Create a storage manager in the `infrastructure/` directory to handle Parquet file storage.
   - Implement a DuckDB interface in `adapters/` to facilitate querying of Parquet files.

2. **Data Access**:
   - Define repository interfaces in the `domain/` layer to abstract data access methods.

### Step 4: Implement Processing Layer

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Create a processing module in `application/` that utilizes `Polars` and `DuckDB` for filtering, aggregations, and slicing.
   - Implement use cases that define the core business logic for data processing.

### Step 5: Implement Presentation Layer

1. **API Development**:
   - Set up FastAPI in the `presentation/` directory to handle RESTful API requests.
   - Create endpoints for data ingestion, querying, and processing.

2. **WebSocket Communication**:
   - Implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time data streaming to the frontend.

### Step 6: Testing and Validation

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for each module to ensure functionality and adherence to requirements.
   - Use `pytest` for running tests and validating code coverage.

2. **Performance Benchmarking**:
   - Establish performance benchmarks for data ingestion, querying, and processing operations.

### Step 7: Documentation

1. **API Documentation**:
   - Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or ReDoc integrated with FastAPI.
   - Create a detailed setup and deployment guide for future developers.

## Future Considerations

- Ensure that the architecture remains flexible to allow for easy swapping, extending, or upgrading of libraries, functions, classes, stacks, tools, and frameworks.
- Regularly review and refactor the codebase to maintain adherence to SOLID principles and DDD practices.

By following this structured plan, we can effectively transition to a modular, scalable FastAPI backend that meets the project's requirements for handling large datasets efficiently.

# Performance Optimization Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines best practices for optimizing the performance of the Data Science App.

## Caching Strategies

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce load times and improve response times.

## Efficient Data Handling

- Use lazy loading and chunking techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Optimize data transformations to minimize processing time.

## Resource Management

- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) and adjust configurations as necessary to ensure optimal performance.

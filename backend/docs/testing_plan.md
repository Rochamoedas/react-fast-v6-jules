# Testing Implementation Plan for FastAPI Modular Backend

## Overview

This document outlines the testing implementation plan for the FastAPI modular backend, focusing on the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD), SOLID, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal Architecture, and AKA. The goal is to ensure that the application is thoroughly tested and meets the specified requirements.

## Running tests

From the root run:

   pytest .\tests\unit\ -v --cov=backend --cov-report=term-missing:skip-covered --cov-report=html

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: 
   - Focus on testing individual components in isolation to ensure they function correctly.
   - Each module (e.g., ingestion, processing, storage) will have its own set of unit tests.

2. **Integration Tests**: 
   - Test the interaction between different modules to ensure they work together as expected.
   - Focus on critical paths, such as data flow from ingestion to storage and querying.

3. **End-to-End Tests**: 
   - Validate the entire application flow from the frontend to the backend and back.
   - Ensure that the application meets user requirements and behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.

## Testing Framework

- **pytest**: The primary testing framework to be used for writing and executing tests.
- **pytest-cov**: To measure code coverage and ensure that tests cover a significant portion of the codebase.

## Test Organization

- Tests will be organized in a dedicated `tests/` directory at the root level of the project.
- The structure will mirror the application structure for easy navigation:
  ```
  tests/
  ├── adapters/
  ├── application/
  ├── domain/
  ├── infrastructure/
  └── presentation/
  ```

## Test Cases

### Fetch Routine
- **Test Case 1**: Validate that the data fetching module correctly retrieves data from configured sources.
- **Test Case 2**: Ensure that the module handles errors gracefully (e.g., network issues, invalid URLs).

### Query Routine
- **Test Case 1**: Verify that the DuckDB interface correctly queries data from Parquet files.
- **Test Case 2**: Test various query scenarios, including filtering and aggregations.

### Calculate Routine
- **Test Case 1**: Validate that the calculation module performs expected calculations accurately.
- **Test Case 2**: Ensure that edge cases (e.g., empty datasets, extreme values) are handled correctly.

### Transform Routine
- **Test Case 1**: Verify that the transformation module correctly converts data into the desired format.
- **Test Case 2**: Test the performance of the transformation process with large datasets.

### Run Calculation Routines
- **Test Case 1**: Ensure that the run calculation routine orchestrates the fetching, querying, and processing correctly.
- **Test Case 2**: Validate that the entire workflow produces the expected results.

## Continuous Integration

- Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that tests are run automatically on each commit or pull request.
- Use tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI to automate the testing process and report results.

By following this testing implementation plan, we can ensure that the FastAPI modular backend is robust, reliable, and meets the project's requirements for handling large datasets efficiently.
